# Odin-Project-Knights-Travails
This project involves creating a function, knightMoves, to calculate the shortest path a knight takes on a chessboard to travel between two coordinates. You'll implement a suitable search algorithm, ensure valid moves stay on the board, and output the complete path, showcasing the knight's movement.
